# Zoot

Zoot is still learning but is here to help where it can. Currently the support conversations are:

* Hello
* What's On?
* Venues
* Help

Go on, say hi to Zoot over at: https://m.me/rootytootyzooty


# Hello

Simply say hi! 

Examples include:
> sup    
> Hey    
> Hello    
> hi    


# What's On?

The core feature Zoot offers. This will return to gigs around town that Zoot is aware of. It can return todays shows or accepts filters for dates and/or venues.

Examples include:
> Hey Zoot, what's on?    
> Who's playing at Jazzlab tonight?    
> What're the cool gigs next Wednesday?

If all went well you should hopefully see something like:

# Venues

Returns the venues around town. Please note, data is not currently available for all venues.

Examples include:
> What're the cool venues?    
> What're the hip joints around town?    
> Where're the cool hangs?

If all went well you should hopefully see something like:
